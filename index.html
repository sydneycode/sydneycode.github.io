            <p>After graduating from UC Irvine with a B.S. in Information and Computer Science, 
                I decided to pursue my passion for the equestrian sport of dressage.  I have 
                spent a few years riding and training horses, but now I am ready to start a 
                career in the tech industry.</p>
            <p>I applied to the UCI Coding Boot Camp in order to refresh my coding skills 
                and get up-to-date on programming languages and tools for web and software 
                development.  The primary programming language that I have used is Java,  
                and I have also used R and Python for basic data analysis.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding or practicing dressage (or "horse dancing," as Stephen Colbert 
                would call it), I enjoy hanging out with my cat and watching TV.  
                <i>The Good Place</i> is a current favorite.  
                When I realize that I've been spending too much time in front of a screen, I like 
                to go walking or running while keeping an eye out for wildlife like quail and 
                roadrunners.</p>
