            <p>After graduating from UC Irvine with a B.S. in Information and Computer Science, 
                I decided to pursue my passion for the equestrian sport of dressage.  I have 
                spent a few years riding and training horses, but now I am ready to start a 
                career in the tech industry.</p>
            <p>By attending the UCI Coding Boot Camp, I refreshed my coding skills 
                and gained crucial experience using many fundamental web technologies. I've designed 
                and built websites using HTML and CSS, along with libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, 
                and React.  I've also practiced server-side programming using JavaScript via Node.js 
                and the Express framework.  In addition, I've designed and implemented both SQL and NoSQL 
                databases, using MySQL with a Sequelize ORM and MongoDB with a Mongoose ORM.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding or practicing dressage (or "horse dancing," as Stephen Colbert 
                would call it), I enjoy hanging out with my cat and watching TV.  
                <i>The Good Place</i> is a current favorite.  
                When I realize that I've been spending too much time in front of a screen, I like 
                to go walking or running while keeping an eye out for wildlife like quail and 
                roadrunners.</p>
